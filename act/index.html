    passage: `
    The evolution of human color vision is a fascinating example of adaptation. Most mammals are dichromats, meaning they have two types of cone cells in their retinas. However, primates, including humans, are typically trichromats with three types of cone cells. This adaptation likely evolved as early primates began relying more heavily on fruit as a food source. The ability to distinguish between ripe and unripe fruit, as well as young and mature leaves, provided a significant evolutionary advantage.

    Research suggests that this enhanced color vision came at a cost. The neural machinery required to process three-color vision demands considerable energy and brain space. Additionally, some scientists hypothesize that the trade-off for better color vision might have been a reduction in our ability to see in low-light conditions compared to other mammals.

    passage: `
    The development of the first electronic computers was not a singular event but rather a convergence of mathematical theory, engineering capability, and practical necessity. The ENIAC, completed in 1945, represented a significant milestone but drew upon decades of prior work. Ada Lovelace had written the first algorithm intended for machine processing nearly a century earlier, while working with Charles Babbage's Analytical Engine designs. During World War II, the need for rapid ballistics calculations and code-breaking capabilities accelerated computer development.

    Perhaps surprisingly, early computer development focused less on processing speed and more on reliability and accuracy. The first machines were essentially elaborate calculators, designed to perform specific tasks rather than the general-purpose devices we know today. The transformation from specialized calculating machines to programmable computers required both technological advancement and a fundamental shift in how we conceptualized computation itself. This shift was largely influenced by Alan Turing's theoretical work on computability in the 1930s.
